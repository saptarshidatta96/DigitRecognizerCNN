Description

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de-facto “hello world” data set of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic data set of handwritten images has served as the basis for bench marking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a data set of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
This Notebook contains three main parts:
The data preparation

The CNN modeling and evaluation

The results prediction and submission
